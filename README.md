# ENSIASAR
ENSIASAR is an augmented reality application that helps students navigate their campus and find their classrooms and lecture halls.

With ENSIASAR, students can simply open the app on their smartphone and hold it up to their surroundings. The app will then use augmented reality technology to display a map of the campus, overlaid on the student's real-world view. The map will show the student's current location, as well as the locations of their classrooms and lecture halls. The student can then follow the map to find their way to their destination.

ENSIASAR also includes a search function, allowing students to easily find specific classrooms or lecture halls by name. The app will show the student the location of the room on the map, making it easy for them to navigate to their destination.

ENSIASAR is easy to use and provides a convenient way for students to find their way around campus. Give it a try and make navigating your campus a breeze!
